# Ontologie per gli Apparati IoT Urbani - Modulo Electric Mobility

The following evaluation results have been generated by the [RESTFul web service](http://oops-ws.oeg-upm.net/) provided by [OOPS!](http://oops.linkeddata.es/) (OntOlogy Pitfall Scanner!).

It is obvious that not all the pitfalls are equally important; their impact in the ontology will depend on multiple factors. For this reason, each pitfall has an importance level attached indicating how important it is. We have identified three levels:


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/critical.png" height="15px"> It is crucial to correct the pitfall. Otherwise, it could affect the ontology consistency, reasoning, applicability, etc.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/important.png" height="15px"> Though not critical for ontology function, it is important to correct this type of pitfall.

## Pitfalls



#### P10. Missing disjointness <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/important.png" height="15px"> (1 cases detected).
*The ontology lacks disjoint axioms between classes or between properties that should be defined as disjoint. This pitfall is related with the guidelines provided in [6], [2] and [7].*

    

#### P04. Creating unconnected ontology elements <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/minor.png" height="15px"> (1 cases detected).
*Ontology elements (classes, object properties and datatype properties) are created isolated, with no relation to the rest of the ontology.*

    

#### P08. Missing annotations <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/minor.png" height="15px"> (11 cases detected).
*This pitfall consists in creating an ontology element and failing to provide human readable annotations attached to it. Consequently, ontology elements lack annotation properties that label them (e.g. rdfs:label, lemon:LexicalEntry, skos:prefLabel or skos:altLabel) or that define them (e.g. rdfs:comment or dc:description). This pitfall is related to the guidelines provided in [5].*

    

#### P11. Missing domain or range in properties <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/important.png" height="15px"> (2 cases detected).
*Object and/or datatype properties without domain or range (or none of them) are included in the ontology.*

    

#### P34. Untyped class <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/important.png" height="15px"> (9 cases detected).
*An ontology element is used as a class without having been explicitly declared as such using the primitives owl:Class or rdfs:Class. This pitfall is related with the common problems listed in [8].*

    

#### P35. Untyped property <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/important.png" height="15px"> (10 cases detected).
*An ontology element is used as a property without having been explicitly declared as such using the primitives rdf:Property, owl:ObjectProperty or owl:DatatypeProperty. This pitfall is related with the common problems listed in [8].*

    

#### P13. Inverse relationships not explicitly declared <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/minor.png" height="15px"> (14 cases detected).
*This pitfall appears when any relationship (except for those that are defined as symmetric properties using owl:SymmetricProperty) does not have an inverse relationship (owl:inverseOf) defined within the ontology.*

    

#### P22. Using different naming conventions in the ontology <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/minor.png" height="15px"> (1 cases detected).
*The ontology elements are not named following the same convention (for example CamelCase or use of delimiters as &quot;-&quot; or &quot;_&quot;) . Some notions about naming conventions are provided in [2].*
