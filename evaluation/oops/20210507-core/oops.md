# Ontologie per gli Apparati IoT Urbani - Modulo Core

The following evaluation results have been generated by the [RESTFul web service](http://oops-ws.oeg-upm.net/) provided by [OOPS!](http://oops.linkeddata.es/) (OntOlogy Pitfall Scanner!).

It is obvious that not all the pitfalls are equally important; their impact in the ontology will depend on multiple factors. For this reason, each pitfall has an importance level attached indicating how important it is. We have identified three levels:


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/critical.png" height="15px"> It is crucial to correct the pitfall. Otherwise, it could affect the ontology consistency, reasoning, applicability, etc.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/important.png" height="15px"> Though not critical for ontology function, it is important to correct this type of pitfall.

## Pitfalls



#### P10. Missing disjointness <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/important.png" height="15px"> (1 cases detected).
*The ontology lacks disjoint axioms between classes or between properties that should be defined as disjoint. This pitfall is related with the guidelines provided in [6], [2] and [7].*

    

#### P13. Inverse relationships not explicitly declared <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/minor.png" height="15px"> (25 cases detected).
*This pitfall appears when any relationship (except for those that are defined as symmetric properties using owl:SymmetricProperty) does not have an inverse relationship (owl:inverseOf) defined within the ontology.*

    

#### SUGGESTION: symmetric or transitive object properties.. symmetric or transitive object properties. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/minor.png" height="15px"> (1 cases detected).
*The domain and range axioms are equal for each of the following object properties. Could they be symmetric or transitive?*

    

#### P11. Missing domain or range in properties <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/important.png" height="15px"> (44 cases detected).
*Object and/or datatype properties without domain or range (or none of them) are included in the ontology.*

    

#### P04. Creating unconnected ontology elements <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnToology/oops-report/master/sample/minor.png" height="15px"> (12 cases detected).
*Ontology elements (classes, object properties and datatype properties) are created isolated, with no relation to the rest of the ontology.*
