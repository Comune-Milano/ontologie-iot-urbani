<span class="markdown">
The main concepts of the Electric Mobility module have been modeled by extending the Core module ([http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core)) imported into the ontology and specializing its concepts and properties. There are two types of operator, both [schema:Organization](https://schema.org/Organization), where in case of [uiote:ChargePointOperator](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargePointOperator) it’s referred to the operator which provides the power in the charging stations ([uiote:ChargingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargingStation)) with [uiote:operatesSession](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#operateSession), and the [uiote:eMobilityServiceProvider](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#eMobilityServiceProvider) which manages the charging service. In case both the roles overlaps for some services, the unique operator would be inserted in both.

A [uiote:ChargingService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargingService) (subclass of [schema:Service](https://schema.org/Service)) is a charging service managed by a [uiote:eMobilityServiceProvider](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#eMobilityServiceProvider) by [uiote:providesChargingService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#providesChargingService], which enables charging sessions ([uiote:ChargingSession](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargingSession)) by [uiote:enablesCharging](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#enablesCharging). The [uiote:ChargingService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargingService) make also available ([uiote:makesStationAvailable](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#makesStationAvailable)) a specific [uiote:ChargingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargingStation).
</span>

<p align="center"><img src="img/uiote-operators.png" alt="Operators" height="500"></p>

<span class="markdown">
The offer for the Electric Mobility module is represented by [uiote:ChargingServiceOffer](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargingServiceOffer) as a subclass of [schema:Offer](https://schema.org/Offer), from which it inherits the description in terms of identification, name, url, price as fixedAmount described in [Core](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core), currency, and conditions.
Furthermore, a charging offer can have more specific values which determine it, such as prices per minute of charging, per month of charging, per kWh charged or per minute of parking (parking price excluding charging).

An offer ([uiote:ChargingServiceOffer](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargingServiceOffer)) is also associated with a recharge service ([uiote:ChargingService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargingService)) via [schema:itemOffered](https://schema.org/itemOffered). A ([uiote:ChargingServiceOffer](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargingServiceOffer)) can also be associated directly with a ([uiote:ChargingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargingStation)) and represents an offer that can be used directly at the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) for users that are not registered to a charging service.
</span>

<p align="center"><img src="img/uiote-offer.png" alt="Offer" height="350"></p>

<span class="markdown">
A charging station ([uiote:ChargingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargingStation)) is both a [uiot:ServiceResource](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServiceResource) and a [uiot:MobilityStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#MobilityStation). From the latter it inherits the description of the identifier, the name, the description of the station, the url and the image that represents it. In addition, a charging station can be associated with some boolean values for the following properties:
- [uiote:isPrivate](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#isPrivate), that indicates if the Electric Vechicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) is private. 
- [uiote:chargingDuringClosure](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#chargingDuringClosure), that specifies if the Electric Vechicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) allows the charging also during the closure time. 
- [uiote:renewableSources](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#renewableSources), specifies if the charging was done using renewable sources. 

A charging station can be described by the place where it is located, using [dct:Location](http://purl.org/dc/terms/Location), and can have different points of interest on the same area, described with [schema:Place](https://schema.org/Place), by the property [uiote:hasFacilityNearBy](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#hasFacilityNearBy).

Inside the charging station you can find several charging columns ([uiote: EVSE](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#EVSE)), owned ([uiote:hasEVSE](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#hasEVSE)) from the station itself. In addition, the station can have its own offer ([uiote:ChargingServiceOffer](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargingServiceOffer)), which is made available by a specific charging service ([uiote:ChargingService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargingService)), is operated by a charging point operator ([uiote:ChargePointOperator](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargePointOperator)) and can be used in a charging session ([uiote:ChargingSession](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargingSession)). It can also have a recharging point sub-operator, identified as [schema:Organization](https://schema.org/Organization) through the property [uiote:hasSubChargePointOperator](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#hasSubChargePointOperator), and a column owner (always represented in [schema:Organization](https://schema.org/Organization)), via [uiote:hasChargingStationOwner](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#hasChargingStationOwner).

<span class="markdown">
An Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment ([uiote:EVSE](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#EVSE)), subclass of [sosa:Sensor](http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Sensor), is associated to a charging station ([uiote:ChargingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargingStation)) by [uiote:isEVSEOf](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#isEVSEOf) and it is described by the following attributes: anonymous identifier ([dct:identifier](http://purl.org/dc/terms/identifier)), a serial number ([uiote:serialNumber](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#serialNumber)), the floor level ([uiote:floorLevel](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#floorLevel)) and the image which represents it ([schema:image](https://schema.org/image)). Furthermore, its location is described by [dct:Location](http://purl.org/dc/terms/Location). 

Each Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment ([uiote:EVSE](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#EVSE)) is completed by three properties associated to SKOS vocabularies which model the parking restrictions ([el-kos:parking-restriction](http://w3id.org/urban-iot/kos/electric/parking-restriction)), the charging access methods ([el-kos:charge-access-method](http://w3id.org/urban-iot/kos/electric/charge-access-method)) and the charging categories for the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment ([el-kos:EVSE-charge-category](http://w3id.org/urban-iot/kos/electric/EVSE-charge-category)).

For each ([uiote:EVSE](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#EVSE)) at least one connector ([uiote:Connector](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#Connector)) and some ([uiote:EVSERecord](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#EVSERecord)) are associated. As far as concern the former, it is described by a unique identifier, by a boolean value which identifies the presence of the charging cable, the minimum maximum amount of amperage, voltage and power provided. In addition, the connector descibes the available plug types with [mv:PlugType](http://schema.mobivoc.org/#PlugType) and, with the property associated to SKOS [el-kos:power-supply](http://w3id.org/urban-iot/kos/electric/power-supply), the power supply is modeled.

<span class="markdown">
Finally also the charging session [uiote:ChargingSession](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#CharginSession) is described, which is a [uiot:UsageSession](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#UsageSession), from which it also inherits a boolean [uiot:reservationUsed](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#reservationUsed), which specifies the following information: an anonymous identifier ([dct:identifier](http://purl.org/dc/terms/identifier)), the boolean which describes if the user that performs the charging session is registered or not ([uiote:registeredUser](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#registeredUser)), the total energy provided expressed in kWh ([uiote:totalEnergy](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#totalEnergy)), the duration of the charging session ([uiote:chargingSessionDuration](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#chargingSessionDuration)) and the real charging time expressed in minutes ([uiote:rechargeTimeMin](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#rechargeTimeMin)).

A charging session [uiote:ChargingSession](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#CharginSession) is also associated to its [uiote:ChargePointOperator](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargePointOperator) which provides the charge, to a ([uiote:ChargingService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargingService) who enables the charge, to a dedicated offer [uiote:ChargingServiceOffer](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#CharginServiceOffer) by the property [uiot:offerAssociated](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#OfferAssociated), to a user which performs the charge ([uiot:ServicePrivateUser](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServicePrivateUser)), to a [uiote:EVSE](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#EVSE), to a connector ([uiote:Connector](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#Connector)) that is used during the charge in a charging station ([uiote:ChargingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#CharginStation)).

<h3 id="examples" class="list">Usage examples</h3>

<span class="markdown">
[JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) allows you to annotate a JSON document to represent Linked Data. The examples of use of the Ontologies suite for Urban IoT Devices are provided in this format to help in the definition of semantically annotated APIs, according to the defined vocabulary, by the service providers. The examples that will be presented take the following [urban-iot-context.jsonld](../urban-iot-context.jsonld). All examples can be edited, viewed or converted to other formats using the [JSON LD Playground](https://json-ld.org/playground) already initialized with the urban-iot context at the following [link](https://tinyurl.com/yy3abvss).

The following example describes an Electric Mobility service provider that performs both the role of [uiote:ChargePointOperator](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargePointOperator) as it operates a network of [uiote:ChargingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargingStation), and the role of [uiote:eMobilityServiceProvider](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#eMobilityServiceProvider) making a charging service is available for users ([uiote:ChargingService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric#ChargingService)) on a network of Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). The example shows the case in which the charging stations offered by the service are greater than those operated directly by the supplier.
