<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Electric Mobility Module of the ontology suite for the Urban IoT Devices ([http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric)). This module reuses the concepts and the principal properties defined by the Core Module ([http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core)), in the Electric Mobility domain. In particular, the module designs the aspects related to a service provider for the Electric Mobility who manages the IoT devices in the urban area, the service usage by the users and the modelling of an IoT device which collects and sends data.
