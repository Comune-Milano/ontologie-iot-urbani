<span class="markdown">
The main concepts of the Sharing Mobility module have been modeled by extending the Core module ([http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core)) imported into ontology and specializing its concepts and properties. In the considered domain, a Sharing Mobility service provider can be modeled as a [uiots:SharingMobilityProvider](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingMobilityProvider) which delivers one or more [uiots:SharingMobilityService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingMobilityService). A service provides users with a series of [uiots:SharingMobilityVehicle](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityVehicle) which form a network of urban IoT devices on city soil. The vehicles can be used through the service in trip sessions ([uiots:SharingMobilityTrip](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityTrip)). The fee for using the service can be modeled as a [uiots:SharingMobilityOffer](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityOffer) which extends the modeling of [schema:Offer](https://schema.org/Offer) allowing to define a fixed cost of the offer, and/or a trip cost per minute ([uiots:pricePerTripMinute](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#pricePerTripMinute)), and/or a cost per km traveled during the trip ([uiots:pricePerTripKm](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#pricePerTripKm)).

Service users are modeled as [uiot:ServiceUser](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServiceUser) defined in the Core module. A [uiot:ServicePrivateUser](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServicePrivateUser) is associated with the [uiots:SharingMobilityService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingMobilityService) which uses and to the [uiots:SharingMobilityTrip](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityTrip) made.

A [uiots:SharingMobilityService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingMobilityService) can also be associated with one or more [uiots:SharingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingStation) for the release/collection of vehicles. A [uiots:SharingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingStation) can in turn be modeled as an urban IoT device that emits data on the state of the station.

<span class="markdown">
A [uiots:SharingMobilityService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingMobilityService) and a [uiots:SharingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingStation) are associated to a [uiots:SharingMobilityCategory](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingMobilityCategory) which identifies the type of associated vehicles. The instances defined for [uiots:SharingMobilityCategory](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingMobilityCategory) in the ontology are: [uiots:CarSharing](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/CarSharing), [uiots:BicycleSharing](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/BicycleSharing), [uiots:MotorcycleSharing](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/MotorcycleSharing) and [uiots:MicroMobilitySharing](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/MicroMobilitySharing).

A [uiots:SharingMobilityService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingMobilityService) can be associated to a boolean value through the propriety [uiots:allowsFreeFloating](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/allowsFreeFloating), if positive it defines that the service allows the release/collection of vehicles on the street, if negative it defines that vehicles can be taken/released only within a [uiots:SharingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingStation) associated with the service. 

A [uiots:SharingMobilityService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingMobilityService) is further associated to a series of [geosparql:Feature](http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#Feature), definable through a serialization, which represent a series of spatial information associated with the service. In particular, the following are modeled:
- [uiots:ContractualOperationArea](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/ContractualOperationArea): minimum operating limits defined by the authority for the Sharing Mobility Services (they can coincide with the city borders).
- [uiots:OperationArea](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/OperationArea): the operational area of the service defined by the service provider in which vehicles can circulate. The area must include the minimum operating boundaries defined by the authority but may be more extensive.
- [uiots:PickUpDropOffArea](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/PickUpDropOffArea): area that defines an area where vehicles can be taken/released. These areas must be defined if they do not coincide with the operational area of the service.
- [uiots:ForbiddenDropOffArea](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/ForbiddenDropOffArea): area that defines an area where vehicles cannot be released.
- [uiots:PreferredPickUpArea](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/PreferredPickUpArea): area that defines an area where picking up of vehicles by the service users is encouraged.
- [uiots:PreferredDropOffArea](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/PreferredDropOffArea): area that defines an area where the release of vehicles by the service users is encouraged.

A [uiots:SharingMobilityTrip](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityTrip) represents a [uiot:UsageSession](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#UsageSession) enabled from a [uiots:SharingMobilityService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingMobilityService) of a [uiots:SharingMobilityVehicle](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityVehicle) from a [uiot:ServicePrivateUser](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServicePrivateUser).

In case of a [uiots:SharingMobilityService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingMobilityService) which operates through a [uiots:SharingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingStation), the [uiots:SharingMobilityTrip](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityTrip) can also be associated with the station of start of end of the trip.

The route associated with a trip can be represented by two representations: an ordered series of registered position ([uiots: TripPoint](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/TripPoint)) or a spatial representation of the entire route ([uiots:TripRoute](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/TripRoute)). In cases in which the entire route is not available, it is possible to associate the starting and ending trip point using respectively the properties [uiots:hasTripStartingPoint](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/hasTripStartingPoint) and [uiots:hasTripEndingPoint](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/hasTripEndingPoint).

The [uiots:SharingMobilityService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingMobilityService) is further described with a series of dataproperties:
- anonymous identifier ([dct:identifier](http://purl.org/dc/terms/identifier))
- covered distance in kilometers ([uiots:coveredDistanceInKm](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#coveredDistanceInKm))
- total trip duration ([uiots:tripDuration](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#tripDuration)), movement time in minutes ([uiots:movingTimeInMin](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#movingTimeInMin)), parking time in minutes ([uiots:parkingTimeInMin](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#parkingTimeInMin))
- percentage of fuel/charge at trip begin/end ([uiots:fuelStartingPercentage](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#fuelStartingPercentage), [uiots:fuelEndingPercentage](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#fuelEndingPercentage), [uiots:chargeStartingPercentage](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#chargeStartingPercentage), [uiots:chargeEndingPercentage](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#chargeEndingPercentage))
- evaluation of the  inner/outer vehicle conditions by the user ([uiots:userFeedbackVehicleInterior](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#userFeedbackVehicleInterior), [uiots:userFeedbackVehicleExterior](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#userFeedbackVehicleExterior))

<span class="markdown">
A [uiots:SharingMobilityVehicle](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityVehicle) is made available from a [uiots:SharingMobilityService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingMobilityService) and can be used for a [uiots:SharingMobilityTrip](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityTrip).

A [uiots:SharingMobilityVehicle](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityVehicle) is a [schema:Vehicle](https://schema.org/Vehicle) that is registered within a service fleet and equipped with devices for communicating and receiving data that make it an urban IoT device. A [uiots:SharingMobilityVehicle](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityVehicle) is described by an anonymous identifier, by an identifier visible on the device, by the date of entry into the fleet and, possibly, by the date of disposal. In case the vehicle is associate to a [uiots:SharingMobilityService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingMobilityService) based on [uiots:SharingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/SharingStation) in which there are different types of dock, the vehicle can be associated with the instances of [uiots:DockKind](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/DockKind) supported by the vehicle.

A [schema:Vehicle](https://schema.org/Vehicle) is modelled by the properties of [schema:](https://schema.org/) which allow to specify the registration date, the chassis number, the production date, the number of seats, the brand, the model. The property [uiots:longestRangeInKm](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#longestRangeInKm) allows to specify the maximum theorical distance that can be traveled with a full tank of fuel/charge. The description of a [schema:Vehicle](https://schema.org/Vehicle) it is completed through three properties associated with SKOS vocabularies that model the type of vehicle propulsion ([vh-kos:propulsion-kind](http://w3id.org/urban-iot/kos/vehicle/propulsion-kind)), the vehicle category according to the international classification ([vh-kos:vehicle-category](http://w3id.org/urban-iot/kos/vehicle/vehicle-category)) and the European vehicle polluting emissions standard ([vh-kos:european-emission-standard](http://w3id.org/urban-iot/kos/vehicle/european-emission-standard)). A [uiots:Car](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#Car), vehicle specialization that represents a car can be described through a further SKOS that represents the type of power supply of the car [vh-kos:car-supply](http://w3id.org/urban-iot/kos/vehicle/car-supply).

A [uiots:SharingMobilityVehicle](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityVehicle) can be a [uiots:SharingMobilityCar](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityCar), a [uiots:SharingMobilityBicycle](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityBicycle), a [uiots:SharingMobilityMotorcycle](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityMotorcycle) or a [uiots:SharingMicroMobilityVehicle](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMicroMobilityVehicle). Through multi-inheritance relationships it is possible to model the vehicle class in more detail.

<span class="markdown">
A [uiots:SharingMobilityVehicle](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityVehicle) is an IoT device that register a series of [uiots:SharingMobilityVehicleRecord](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityVehicleRecord). 

A [uiots:SharingMobilityVehicleRecord](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityVehicleRecord) is a [uiot:SensorRecord](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#SensorRecord) and for this reason it is associated with the timestamp in which it is collected, to the recording sensor and to a series of [sosa:Observation](http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Observation) contained in the record. The following properties ([sosa:ObservableProperty](http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/ObservableProperty)) can be sampled from a [uiots:SharingMobilityVehicle](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityVehicle) are defined in the ontology:
- vehicle position ([uiots:VehicleLocation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#VehicleLocation)), for which the relative [sosa:Observation](http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Observation) has as expected result a [geo:Point](http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#Point),
- charge level ([uiots:ChargePercentage](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#ChargePercentage)), for which the relative [sosa:Observation](http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Observation) has a simple expected result a [xsd:int](http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int),
- fuel level ([uiots:FuelPercentage](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#FuelPercentage)), for which the relative [sosa:Observation](http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Observation) has a simple expected result a [xsd:int](http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int).

A [uiots:SharingMobilityVehicleRecord](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityVehicleRecord) is further characterized by a state representation of the [uiots:SharingMobilityVehicle](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityVehicle), which can have a value among those defined in [sh-kos:vehicle-state](http://w3id.org/urban-iot/kos/sharing/vehicle-state), and a representation of the last recorded event for the vehicle, where possible events are defined in [sh-kos:vehicle-event](http://w3id.org/urban-iot/kos/sharing/vehicle-event). A [uiots:SharingMobilityVehicleRecord](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityVehicleRecord) can also be associated to a [uiots:SharingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingStation) in which the vehicle is at the moment of its registration.

<span class="markdown">
A [uiots:SharingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingStation) can be associated to a specific [uiots:SharingService](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingService) or can be made available in different services belonging to the same [uiots:SharingServiceCategory](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingServiceCategory).

A [uiots:SharingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingStation) is a [uiot:MobilityStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#MobilityStation) dedicated to Sharing Mobility; from this inheritance the properties that they model and the possibility of being associated with a [dct:Location](http://purl.org/dc/terms/Location) to represent its address and its geometry.

A [uiots:SharingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingStation) can be of two types: a [uiots:PhysicalSharingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/PhysicalSharingStation) if equipped with a physical infrastructure (i.e. docks) for picking up/dropping off vehicles, or one [uiots:VirtualSharingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/VirtualSharingStation).

A [uiots:PhysicalSharingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/PhysicalSharingStation) is characterized by the [uiots:Dock](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/Dock) which compose it, which total number is represented by the property [uiots:numberOfDocks](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/numberOfDocks). A [uiots:Dock](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/Dock) can be associated to a dock type ([uiots:DockKind](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/DockKind)) if different vehicles use different docks.

A [uiots:SharingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingStation) a the possible [uiots:Dock](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing/Dock) contained inside can be modelled as urban IoT devices which transmit data.

A [uiots:SharingStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingStation) registers a [uiots:SharingStationRecord](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingStationRecord) and can observe the following [sosa:ObservableProperty](http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/ObservableProperty):
- number of available vehicles ([uiots:AvailableVehicles](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#AvailableVehicles)), simple expected result [xsd:int](http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int),
- number of damaged vehicles ([uiots:DamagedVehicles](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#DamagedVehicles)), simple expected result [xsd:int](http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int),
- number of available docks ([uiots:AvailableDocks](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#AvailableDocks)), simple expected result [xsd:int](http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int),
- number of damaged docks ([uiots:DamagedDocks](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#DamagedDocks)), simple expected result [xsd:int](http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int).

A [uiots:SharingStationRecord](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingStationRecord) can be associated to the docks record ([uiots:DockRecord](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#DockRecord)) in the station. A [uiots:DockRecord](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#DockRecord) is characterized by:
- detection timestamp, 
- dock state, which possible values are defined in [sh-kos:dock-state](http://w3id.org/urban-iot/kos/sharing/dock-state)
A [uiots:DockRecord](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#DockRecord) can be also associated to a [uiots:SharingMobilityVehicle](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing#SharingMobilityVehicle) which is currently in the dock.

<h3 id="examples" class="list">Usage examples</h3>

<span class="markdown">
[JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) allows you to annotate a JSON document to represent Linked Data. The examples of use of the Ontologies suite for Urban IoT Devices are provided in this format to help in the definition of semantically annotated APIs, according to the defined vocabulary, by the service providers. The examples that will be presented take the following [urban-iot-context.jsonld](../urban-iot-context.jsonld). All examples can be edited, viewed or converted to other formats using the [JSON LD Playground](https://json-ld.org/playground) already initialized with the urban-iot context at the following [link](https://tinyurl.com/yy3abvss).
