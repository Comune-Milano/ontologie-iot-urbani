This section describes the classes and properties of the Core module in detail, through a series of diagrams and usage examples, the choices made in the modeling phase and the expected usage methods.</span>

<h3 id="examples" class="list">Diagrams</h3>

<span class="markdown">
The diagrams in this section are modeled using the notation presented below.

<span class="markdown">
The main concepts of the Core module have been modeled by extending the [schema.org](http://schema.org) vocabulary.  A service provider can be modeled as a [schema:Organization](https://schema.org/Organization) that provides one or more [schema:Service](https://schema.org/Service). The service offered can make available for the users some [uiot:ServiceResource](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServiceResource) that can be used by the service in usage session [uiot:UsageSession](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#UsageSession). The offer for the usage can be modeled as a [schema:Offer](https://schema.org/Offer); all the offers can be associated to the service that made them available. Furthermore, the specific offer, if applied to a usage session, can be directly associated to the latter.

Service users are modeled as [uiot:ServiceUser](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServiceUser) and can be [uiot:ServicePrivateUser](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServicePrivateUser), namely physical persons (subclass of [schema:Person](https://schema.org/Person)) subscribed to a service, or [uiot:ServiceBusinessUser](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServiceBusinessUser) namely legal entity (subclass of [legal:LegalEntity](http://www.w3.org/ns/legal#LegalEntity)) subscribed to a business contract.
Only a [uiot:ServicePrivateUser](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServicePrivateUser) can performs a [uiot:UsageSession](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#UsageSession). A [uiot:ServiceBusinessUser](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServiceBusinessUser) can enable a list of  [uiot:ServicePrivateUser](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServicePrivateUser)  to the service usage and to be associated to a usage session. However, it is not necessary to specify the physical person that used the service by the specific business contract.

The following two diagrams provide a detailed description of the previous one, specifying further properties that are defined or reused to describe the presented concepts.

A [uiot:UsageSession](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#UsageSession) is a [schema:Event](https://schema.org/Event) from which it  inherits the description in terms of starting instant, ending instant and duration. A usage session can be also associated to a boolean value for the property [uiot:reservationUsed](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#reservationUsed) that specifies if the session has been booked in advance by the user.

A [uiot:ServiceUser](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServiceUser) is modeled by an anonymous identifier ([dct:identifier](http://purl.org/dc/terms/identifier)), by the date of subscription to the service ([uiot:registrationDate](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#registrationDate)) and in case by the date of subscription cancellation from the service ([uiot:deregistrationDate](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#deregistrationDate)).
A [uiot:ServiceUser](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServiceUser) is associated to a [schema:Service](https://schema.org/Service) to which it is registered through the property [uiot:registeredTo](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#registeredTo). It can be also associated to other services for which the same subscription enables the usage (e.g., working car sharing services in more cities) in the moment he makes at least one [uiot:UsageSession](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#UsageSession) for that service.

The proposed modeling for the [uiot:ServiceUser](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServiceUser) is reduced, as the data protection rules often do not allow the representation of personal information. However, the classes [schema:Person](https://schema.org/Person) and [legal:LegalEntity](http://www.w3.org/ns/legal#LegalEntity), the extended from [uiot:ServicePrivateUser](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServicePrivateUser) and [uiot:ServiceBusinessUser](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServiceBusinessUser), allow the modeling of further information with respect to the ones indicated. The properties presented in the diagram do model the socio-demographic information that are judged relevant to analyze the service usage by the domain experts.

A [uiot:ServicePrivateUser](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServicePrivateUser) is described by gender ([schema:gender](https://schema.org/gender)), year of birth ([uiot:birthYear](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#birthYear)), address ([locn:Address](http://www.w3.org/ns/locn#Address)), city ([locn:postName](http://www.w3.org/ns/locn#postName)), and zip code ([locn:postCode](http://www.w3.org/ns/locn#postCode)). A [uiot:ServiceBusinessUser](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#ServiceBusinessUser) is described by the address of the operative office in terms of city and zip code. The usage of the Core vocabulary can be declined accordingly to the national profiles, for example an Italian address can be described in the Italian profile ([profilo italiano](<https://w3id.org/italia/onto/CLV/>)), aligned with the ontology `locn:`.

<span class="markdown">
A service that operates in the urban area is modeled as a [schema:Service](https://schema.org/Service) with the following properties:
- identifier, name, description, url and time zone,
- the [schema:Organization](https://schema.org/Organization) which supplies the service, 
- the [schema:Place](https://schema.org/Place) which represents the activity area of the service, 
- the opening hours definition by [schema:OpeningHoursSpecification](https://schema.org/OpeningHoursSpecification), 
- the channels to access the service [schema:ServiceChannel](https://schema.org/ServiceChannel) that can include applications or websites,
- the offers ([schema:Offer](https://schema.org/Offer)) with which is possible to use the service.

An operator that supplies a service is modeled as a [schema:Organization](https://schema.org/Organization) described by an identifier, name, legal name, url, time zone, and contact points ([schema:ContactPoint](https://schema.org/ContactPoint)).

A service offer is modeled by a ([schema:Offer](https://schema.org/Offer)) described by an identifier, name, url, price, currency price, and item conditions (type of users to whom it is addressed, how the price is applied, etc.). The ontology defines the property ([uiot:fixedAmount](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#fixedAmount)) to allow to indicate a fixed price for the offer.

<span class="markdown">
For the modelling of an IoT urban device the Core module uses the pattern [SOSA](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/) defined in the related ontology. Intuitively, an IoT urban device can be seen as a [sosa:Sensor](http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Sensor) (or an aggregation of sensors) that emits [sosa:Observation](http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Observation).  The latter reports the sampled value of a series of [sosa:Sensor](http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Sensor). The following pattern guarantees the extensibility of sampled properties from a sensor, allowing the definition of different [sosa:Observation](http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Observation) associated to a sensor. A [sosa:Observation](http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Observation) can have a simple value described by a data property ([sosa:hasSimpleResult](http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/hasSimpleResult)) or a value described by object property ([sosa:hasResult](http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/hasResult)).

In the Core module [uiot:SensorRecord](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#SensorRecord) is defined as an aggregation of data received by a sensor in the same moment. In particular, a [uiot:SensorRecord](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#SensorRecord) can contain a series of [sosa:Observation](http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Observation). A [sosa:Sensor](http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Sensor) is associated to the [uiot:SensorRecord](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#SensorRecord) it has emitted, and in particular the property [uiot:latestRecord](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#latestRecord) identifies the last record recorded.

<span class="markdown">
The Core module models also a [uiot:MobilityStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#MobilityStation) as a place where different services are aggregated for the urban mobility and IoT urban devices, for the supply/fruition of some services, like for example sharing stations for the sharing mobility (cfr. [uiots](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/sharing)) or charging stations (cfr. [uiote](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/electric)).

A [uiot:MobilityStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#MobilityStation) is a place ([schema:Place](https://schema.org/Place)) described by a [dct:Location](http://purl.org/dc/terms/Location) that can be defined by an address ([locn:Address](http://www.w3.org/ns/locn#Address)) and/or a spatial representation by geometry ([locn:Geometry](http://www.w3.org/ns/locn#Geometry)). [locn:Geometry](http://www.w3.org/ns/locn#Geometry) defines the concept that it can be serialized in different formats as indicated in the [Core Location](http://www.w3.org/ns/locn) ontology, e.g., [GeoSPARQL](http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql). 

A [uiot:MobilityStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#MobilityStation) can be modeled as an aggregation of specific [uiot:MobilityStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#MobilityStation) for a specified services, by the property [uiot:includedInMobilityStation](http://www.w3id.org/urban-iot/core#includedInMobilityStation).

<h3 id="examples" class="list">Usage examples</h3>

<span class="markdown">
[JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) allows you to annotate a JSON document to represent Linked Data. The examples of use of the suite of Ontologies for Urban IoT Devices are provided in this format to help in the definition of semantically annotated APIs, according to the defined vocabulary, by the service providers. The examples that will be presented take the following [urban-iot-context.jsonld](../urban-iot-context.jsonld). All examples can be edited, viewed or converted to other formats using the [JSON LD Playground](https://json-ld.org/playground) already initialized with the urban-iot context at the following [link](https://tinyurl.com/yy3abvss).
